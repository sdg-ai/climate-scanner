As in all Y-PLAN projects, students started phase one by connecting with their lived experience through writing \u201cWhere I\u2019m From\u201d poems and conducting an activity situating themselves in the city. During phase two, they mapped their community, analyzed its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, designed and conducted resident surveys and stakeholder interviews, and researched global best practices for sea level rise, housing, transportation, and education."}

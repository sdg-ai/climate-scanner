Agricultural policies with both sustainability and poverty reduction aims should adopt a multi-track approach that emphasizes five components: (i) small farmer development linked to local markets, (ii) agri-business development\u2014both small businesses and export-led, (iii) agro-processing and value-added activities to ensure that returns are maximized in-country, (iv) urban agriculture, as many urban people rely on small-scale urban food production that rarely appears in national statistics, and (v) livestock development to meet local increases in demand for meat (predicted to increase as economies become richer). In industrialized countries, however, it is perverse subsidies that still promote harm to the environment (Myers & Kent 2003), though agricultural reforms are now putting into place systems that pay for the provision of environmental services and the development of multifunctional agriculture (Kenkel & Manning 1999; Terwan et al."}

Summary\nGlobalization gives large transnational corporations power over agriculture, generating an exodus of farmers and making it impossible to end hunger in the World because production ends up in the hands of only those who can afford it. The market cannot end hunger because it is not made to satisfy needs, and does not balance supply and need, but rather supply and demand."}

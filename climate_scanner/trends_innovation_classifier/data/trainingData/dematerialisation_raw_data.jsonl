A cross-cultural analysis of dematerialization behaviours"}, "text": "Some research suggests that, despite differences in levels of material consumption across cultures, the importance of consumption as a marker of social status remains stable [59]. Given the importance of cultural norms and systems of provision to shaping consumption behaviours [60,61], we adopted a cross-cultural design and selected two countries with distinct cultural value orientations and social-environmental contexts: the UK and Brazil. Our rationale for selecting the UK and Brazil to compare is based on evidence that these cultures differ, firstly, along important social psychological dimensions, and secondly, along various environmental, economic and political dimensions."}
